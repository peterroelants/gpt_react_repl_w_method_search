Execute the given task in steps. Use the following dialog format:

TASK: The input task to execute by taking actions step by step.
THOUGHT 1:
Reason step-by-step which action to take next to solve the task. Make sure no steps are forgotten. Use `method_search(description: str)` to find methods to execute each step.
ACTION 1:
```Python
method_search("description_xyzzy")  # Search method to execute next step
```
OBSERVATION 1:
`foo(bar, ...)`: Method related to "description_xyzzy", found using `method_search("description_xyzzy")`.
THOUGHT 2:
Reason if method `foo(bar, ...)` is useful to solve step 1. If not, call `method_search` again.
ACTION 2:
```python
bar = qux[...]  # Format parameters to be used in a method call, any values need to come verbatim from task or observations.
# Make only 1 method call per action!
baz = foo(bar, ...)  # Call method `foo` found by using `method_search(description: str)` in a previous step. Store the result in `baz`, which can be used in following actions. Use descriptive variable names.
print(baz)  # Print the result to be shown in the next observation.
```
OBSERVATION 2:
stdout/stderr of running the previous action.
... (THOUGHT/ACTION/OBSERVATION can repeat N times until the full task is completed)
THOUGHT N:
Reason step-by-step why the full task is completed, and finish if it is.
ACTION N:
```python
stop()  # Make sure the given task, and all its steps, have been executed completely before stopping.
```

Extras Instructions:
- Keep actions simple, call only 1 method per action. Don't chain method calls.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- If needed, get current date using `datetime.now()` and current location using `get_user_location() -> dict`.
- Use `print(var)` to print a variable to be shown in the next observation.
- Importing is not allowed! To execute actions, access is provided to a `method_search(description: str)` method that prints a list of available Python 3 methods (signatures and descriptions) related to a given description. Use the methods returned by `method_search(description: str)` to complete the task. These methods don't need to be imported. Pay attention to the method signatures.
- Any values used need to come word-for-word from the given task or previous observations!


Start Executing the task:

TASK: Send a Slack message to the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents channel with the current weather for London, UK.
THOUGHT 1:
To solve the task I think I need to execute the following steps:
1. Use a weather API to get the current weather for London, UK.
2. Extract the relevant weather information from the API response.
3. Connect to the Slack API with the appropriate credentials.
4. Locate the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents channel in Slack.
5. Compose a message with the current weather information for London, UK.
6. Send the composed message to the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents channel in Slack.
Deviation from these steps might be needed based on following observations.
To start out I need to use the provided `method_search(description: str)` method to search for new methods related to "Use a weather API to get the current weather for London, UK".
ACTION 1:
```python
method_search("Use a weather API to get the current weather for London, UK")
```
OBSERVATION 1:
`get_current_weather(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the current weather for the given location (geographical coordinates).
`get_daily_weather_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the daily weather forecast for the next 7 days for the given location (geographical coordinates).
`get_nasa_astronomy_picture_of_the_day() -> dict`: Get the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).
Not all the above methods might be needed. Use `method_search(description: str)` to search for more available methods if required!
THOUGHT 2:
Based on previous observations, `get_current_weather(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict` seems to be the most relevant method to get the current weather for London, UK. However, I need to find the latitude and longitude for London, UK first.
ACTION 2:
```python
method_search("Find latitude and longitude for London, UK")
```
OBSERVATION 2:
`get_daily_weather_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the daily weather forecast for the next 7 days for the given location (geographical coordinates).
`search_location_geocoordinates(location_name: str) -> list`: Return a list of geo-locations (latitude and longitude) for locations matching the given location name.
`get_current_weather(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict`: Get the current weather for the given location (geographical coordinates).
THOUGHT 3:
Based on previous observations, `search_location_geocoordinates(location_name: str) -> list` seems to be the most relevant method to find the latitude and longitude for London, UK. I will use this method to get the geo-coordinates for London, UK.
ACTION 3:
```python
location_name = "London, UK"
geocoordinates = search_location_geocoordinates(location_name)
print(geocoordinates)
```
OBSERVATION 3:
ERROR: LocationNameError on line 2: `geocoordinates = search_location_geocoordinates(location_name)`: No results found. for 'London, UK'. Simplify the search string!
THOUGHT 4:
Based on previous observations, the search string "London, UK" did not return any results. I will simplify the search string to "London" and try again.
ACTION 4:
```python
location_name = "London"
geocoordinates = search_location_geocoordinates(location_name)
print(geocoordinates)
```
OBSERVATION 4:
[{'name': 'London', 'latitude': 51.50853, 'longitude': -0.12574, 'feature_code': 'PPLC', 'timezone': 'Europe/London', 'population': 7556900, 'country': 'United Kingdom (GB)', 'administrative_zones': 'Greater London, England'}, {'name': 'London', 'latitude': 42.98339, 'longitude': -81.23304, 'feature_code': 'PPL', 'timezone': 'America/Toronto', 'population': 346765, 'country': 'Canada (CA)', 'administrative_zones': 'Ontario'}, {'name': 'London', 'latitude': 39.88645, 'longitude': -83.44825, 'feature_code': 'PPLA2', 'timezone': 'America/New_York', 'population': 10060, 'country': 'United States (US)', 'administrative_zones': 'City of London, Madison, Ohio'}, {'name': 'London', 'latitude': 37.12898, 'longitude': -84.08326, 'feature_code': 'PPLA2', 'timezone': 'America/New_York', 'population': 8126, 'country': 'United States (US)', 'administrative_zones': 'Laurel, Kentucky'}, {'name': 'London', 'latitude': 35.32897, 'longitude': -93.25296, 'feature_code': 'PPL', 'timezone': 'America/Chicago', 'population': 1046, 'country': 'United States (US)', 'administrative_zones': 'Clark Township, Pope, Arkansas'}]
THOUGHT 5:
Based on previous observations, I found multiple locations named "London". The first result in the list is the London in the United Kingdom, which is the one I am interested in. I will extract the latitude and longitude for London, UK and use the `get_current_weather(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict` method to get the current weather for London, UK.
ACTION 5:
```python
london_uk = geocoordinates[0]
latitude = london_uk['latitude']
longitude = london_uk['longitude']
current_weather = get_current_weather(latitude, longitude)
print(current_weather)
```
OBSERVATION 5:
{'latitude': 51.5, 'longitude': -0.120000124, 'elevation': 23.0, 'current_weather': {'temperature': 13.0, 'windspeed': 8.3, 'winddirection': 355.0, 'is_day': 1, 'time': '2023-04-07T12:00', 'description': 'Partly cloudy'}, 'timezone': 'GMT [GMT]', 'temperature_unit': 'celsius', 'windspeed_unit': 'kmh', 'winddirection_unit': 'degrees'}
THOUGHT 6:
Based on previous observations, I have successfully retrieved the current weather for London, UK. Now, I need to extract the relevant weather information from the API response. I will extract the temperature, windspeed, winddirection, and description from the current_weather dictionary.
ACTION 6:
```python
temperature = current_weather['current_weather']['temperature']
windspeed = current_weather['current_weather']['windspeed']
winddirection = current_weather['current_weather']['winddirection']
description = current_weather['current_weather']['description']
print(temperature, windspeed, winddirection, description)
```
OBSERVATION 6:
13.0 8.3 355.0 Partly cloudy
THOUGHT 7:
Based on previous observations, I have successfully extracted the relevant weather information for London, UK. The next step is to connect to the Slack API with the appropriate credentials. I will use the `method_search(description: str)` method to search for methods related to "Connect to the Slack API".
ACTION 7:
```python
method_search("Connect to the Slack API")
```
OBSERVATION 7:
`send_slack_message(msg: str, channel_id: str)`: Send a message to the Slack channel with the specified ID.
`send_slack_image(img: Image, msg: str, channel: str)`: Send the given image and corresponding message to the Slack channel with the given name or ID.
`get_slack_channel_id(channel_name: str) -> str`: Return the Slack channel ID with the given name.
THOUGHT 8:
Based on previous observations, `get_slack_channel_id(channel_name: str) -> str` seems to be the most relevant method to locate the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents channel in Slack. I will use this method to get the channel ID for the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents channel.
ACTION 8:
```python
channel_name = "#experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents"
channel_id = get_slack_channel_id(channel_name)
print(channel_id)
```
OBSERVATION 8:
C04HN7TCX4Y
THOUGHT 9:
Based on previous observations, I have successfully retrieved the channel ID for the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents channel. The next step is to compose a message with the current weather information for London, UK. I will create a message string containing the temperature, windspeed, winddirection, and description.
ACTION 9:
```python
message = f"Current weather for London, UK:\nTemperature: {temperature}°C\nWindspeed: {windspeed} km/h\nWinddirection: {winddirection}°\nDescription: {description}"
print(message)
```
OBSERVATION 9:
Current weather for London, UK:
Temperature: 13.0°C
Windspeed: 8.3 km/h
Winddirection: 355.0°
Description: Partly cloudy
THOUGHT 10:
Based on previous observations, I have successfully composed a message with the current weather information for London, UK. The final step is to send the composed message to the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents channel in Slack. I will use the `send_slack_message(msg: str, channel_id: str)` method to send the message.
ACTION 10:
```python
send_slack_message(message, channel_id)
```
OBSERVATION 10:
Action executed successfully! No output in stdout/stderr. Assign values returned by methods to variables and use `print()` to output them in the next observation!
THOUGHT 11:
Based on previous observations, I have successfully sent the Slack message to the #experimenting-with-simple-ai-agents channel with the current weather for London, UK. The task is now complete, and I can stop the execution.
ACTION 11:
```python
stop()
```
